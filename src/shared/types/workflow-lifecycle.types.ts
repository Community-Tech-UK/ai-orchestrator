/**
 * B12 — Shared workflow lifecycle projection.
 *
 * The orchestrator runs several kinds of "unit of work", each with its own rich,
 * domain-specific status enum:
 *   - loops          (`LoopStatus`)          — long-running iterative agent runs
 *   - automation runs (`AutomationRunStatus`) — scheduled/triggered one-shot runs
 *   - instances      (`InstanceStatus`)       — live agent processes
 *
 * Those enums are intentionally NOT unified — each carries detail the others don't
 * need (hibernation, completion-review, provider-limit throttling, …). Collapsing
 * them into one enum would force every consumer to carry dead arms and lose meaning.
 *
 * What cross-cutting consumers (dashboards, "is anything still live?", run summaries,
 * the future thin-client event API) actually want is a *coarse projection*: which
 * lifecycle phase is this in, and if terminal, did it end cleanly, fail, or get
 * stopped. This module provides that projection without touching the source enums.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *  - Each projection is an exhaustive `switch` guarded by `assertNever`, so adding a
 *    new status to any source enum is a COMPILE error here until it's mapped. The
 *    projection is therefore self-maintaining — it can never silently fall behind.
 *  - Worker-node connection state and provider activity state are deliberately NOT
 *    projected here: a node connection is infrastructure, and `ActivityState` is an
 *    orthogonal provider signal (a `busy` instance can be activity-`idle`). Mapping
 *    them into a workflow lifecycle would be semantically wrong.
 *
 * This file has zero runtime dependencies beyond the type-only imports, so it is
 * safe to import from main, renderer, and worker contexts alike.

/**
 * Terminal classification — a unit of work has stopped and will not resume on its own.
 *  - `completed`  reached a terminal state without error (clean end-of-life). NOTE:
 *                 this means "finished without failing", not "the produced work was
 *                 good" — quality is a separate concern the source enums may encode.
 *  - `failed`     stopped due to an error or failure-to-converge.
 *  - `cancelled`  deliberately stopped, superseded, or skipped (operator/policy).
