# Test Runner Guide

Use `npm run test:quiet` for local Vitest runs. It prints failures verbatim plus a one-line pass summary and stores the full output in `_scratch/test-run.log`.

## Normal Workflow

Run a focused spec while investigating:

```bash
npm run test:quiet -- path/to/file.spec.ts
```

Run the unsharded full suite once at the final gate:

```bash
npm run test:quiet
```

The default suite excludes `*.e2e.spec.ts` and `**/soak.spec.ts`. Run those with `npm run test:slow`. Load and benchmark suites use `npm run test:load` and `npm run bench`.

### Retrieval evaluation (WS16)

`npm run bench:retrieval` runs the labeled retrieval eval harness against the REAL codemem BM25 + lesson-digest engines over the committed fixture dataset (`benchmarks/retrieval/fixtures/*.jsonl`), reporting Recall@1/5/10 + NDCG@10 with a per-type breakdown and a deterministic dev/held-out split. It compares against the committed baseline (`benchmarks/retrieval/baseline.json`) and **exits non-zero on a regression**, so a ranking change shows a measurable delta before it lands.

- Uses the in-memory wasm sqlite driver, so it runs under plain Node (no native rebuild) and never touches real stores.
- `--update-baseline` locks in an improvement (regenerate the snapshot deliberately).
- `--local` is reserved for the local-personal suite against James's real RLM/codemem stores (READ-ONLY, never committed) — see the WS16 livetest for the manual procedure.
- The synthetic suite also runs in the unit tier (`src/main/memory/retrieval-eval/synthetic-suite.spec.ts`) as a baseline-reproduction guard.

## Cache and CI

- The local cache is enabled by default. After mass deletes or renames, use `AIO_TEST_NO_CACHE=1` or `--no-cache`.
- CI can shard with `npm run test -- --shard=N/4`; local full runs are normally unsharded.
- Vitest projects are `renderer` (jsdom + Angular TestBed) and `main` (jsdom + zone, without Angular). Both remain `singleFork`; CI sharding supplies parallelism.
- On failure, the quiet runner may add a summary from a local Ollama/LM Studio endpoint. Configure `AIO_AUX_LLM_URL` or disable summaries with `AIO_TEST_SUMMARY=0`.
